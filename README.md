# Basic-Cpp-Projects
This repository contains some of my old C++ code, that I wrote at the start of my coding journey. Current projects in this repository are: 

-A calculator that transforms a kg or lb measured weight on earth to its equivalent in various planets.
 The "translations" are based in the following table of conversion:

  1	Mercury   	0.38
  2	Venus     	0.91
  3	Mars	      0.38
  4	Jupiter   	2.34
  5	Saturn	    1.06
  6	Uranus	    0.92
  7	Neptune	    1.19

-A  calculator that transforms a dog's age into its human equivalent.
 According to the used equations the first two years of a dog's life are equivalent to the first 21 years of a human's life, and every year after being equivalent to 4 human years.

-The Fizz Buzz chalenge :

 Coding Challenge created by Imran Ghory.

 "After a fair bit of trial and error I’ve come to discover that people who struggle to code don’t just struggle on big problems, or even smallish problems (i.e. write an implementation of a linked list). They struggle with tiny problems. So I set out to develop questions that can identify this kind of developer and came up with a class of questions I call “FizzBuzz Questions” named after a game children often play (or are made to play) in schools in the UK.” ~ Imran Ghory.

 This short challenge consists in writing a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 100. But that for multiples of 3, prints the word "Fizz" instead of the number, for the multiples of 5, prints "Buzz" and numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 prints "FizzBuzz".
